**_Vær hilset,_**

I am an astrophysics researcher at  the [Oscar Klein Center](http://okc.albanova.se) in Stockholm, Sweden.
My research is focused on the properties and evolution of [Starburst galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starburst_galaxy) and
how  they have  influenced the  evolution  history of  the Universe  from a  few
hundred million years  after the Big Bang  and up till today.  I am particularly
interesting in using  [Gravitational Lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_gravitational_lensing) as a sort of  "natural telescope" to
study extremely  distant, but  highly magnified, starburst  galaxies as  if they
were close  by. I  am also  interested in the  phenomenon of  [Supermassive Black
Holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole),  and their  relation  to star  formation  and how  they  can disrupt  the
interstellar medium of their host galaxies.

Currently, I am funded by a 4-year grant from [Vetenskapsrådet / Swedish Research
Council](https://www.vr.se/),  to search  for and  study gravitationally  lensed starbursts  that are
leaking ionizing UV  light into the Universe,  using cool toys such  as the _[JWST](https://webbtelescope.org/)_
the _[Hubble Space Telescope](https://hubblesite.org/)_, and the ESO [Very Large Telescope](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/). Before this, I was
a postdoc at Stockholm University, working  with [Matthew Hayes](https://xayes.org/pub/), working on Lyman
Continuum  emitters  in the  [Hubble  Ultra  Deep Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field);  and  a  postdoc at  the
University of Oslo,  Norway, working with [Håkon Dahle](https://www.mn.uio.no/astro/english/people/aca/hdahle/index.html)  on gravitationally lensed
starburst galaxies.

I earned my **Ph.D.** from Stockholm University in December 2016, working with Göran
Östlin, and my **Bachelor's** and **Master's** degrees from the [DARK Cosmology Center](https://dark.nbi.ku.dk) at
the Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark, working with [Johan Fynbo](https://www.nbi.dk/~jfynbo/).

I grew  up a bookish redneck  in the countryside  near [Faaborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faaborg), a small  town in
southern Denmark. I now live with my American wife and our two kids.
